  <h1>About Me</h1>
  My name is Kira. I am currently pursuing my computer science degree at UBC with passion about software engineering. My journey into the world of technology is quite unconventional, as my previous academic pursuit was at Law. Although it seems vastly different transitioning from one field to another, I made a bold decision after years of legal assistant to embark on a new career path. I pivot into the world of software development.
  <br />
  <br />
  Throughout my legal practices, I found myself increasingly intrigued by the intersection of law and technology. The legal domain has also been influenced and largely reshaped by the transformative power of technology. Gradually I realize that traditional tedious paperworks and legal tasks could be automated and perfectly completed through software tools. Recognizing this shift, I believe the rapid advancements in software development, artificial intelligence and data analytics had the potential to revolutionize the rule on which the Law will depend to make a new rule for the technology world. My career aspirations has got reshaped since then. I begin to explore new possibilities within the realm of computer science.
  <br />
  <br />
  Fortunately there is a significant overlap between legal domain and my newfound coding world. Thanks to my previous work experience at law, I possess valuable transferable skills that are also advantageous in software engineering. I believe my analytical thinking, problem-solving, attention to detail and research abilities would position me to contribute meaningfully to the development and maintenance of software systems, troubleshooting issues, and collaborating with cross-functional teams. These transferable skills, coupled with my passion for technology, laid a solid foundation for my journey into software development.
  <br />
  <br />
  Attending to the computer science program at UBC helps me acquire new knowledge and skills. Through my solid coursework, I gain a comprehensive understanding of software development and solid skills in programming languages such as Java and C++. I have designed and developed a case management application with Java for facilitating tedious searching and designating jobs for legal practitioners under the environment of Test-Driven-Development. In addition, I applied Unit framework for unit tests to improve quality and performance of the application. I have also gained knowledge of data structures and algorithms during the design of the application. In addition, I understand the need to invest more time and effort in gaining solid coding skills. I embark on a multifaceted learning journey including online courses and self-study. Through this process, I built a self-introduction portfolio to showcase my projects and growing expertise.
  <br />
  <br />
  Looking towards the future, I am excited to explore the diverse opportunities that await me as a computer science undergraduate with interdisciplinary background. I am eager to learn and grow, making a positive impact as part of a dynamic and forward-thinking team of collaboration, learning and profession. With my passion and career aspirations, I embrace the challenges that lie ahead and remain committed to continuous learning, growth, and collaboration with like-minded individuals.   <br />
